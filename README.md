Extract comments from arxiv source files. 


This is still early days, but is somewhat functional. Currently it takes today's arxiv RSS of cond-mat.str.el only, and gets the comments.

## Features

* Get arxiv source file and extract tex files
* Scrape comments from tex and write to file

## TODO

* Refactor to sensible units
* Temporary file storage for source/ extraction
* Comment scraping not perfect
